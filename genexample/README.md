# Generators

* This chapter introduced generators and was very helpful when wrooking with functions, they  demonstrated how generators can break code at times from runninng infinetely and also how they help in a great way to reach a target amount then stopping using yield.
* Programs such as ["FileSearch"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/genexample/filesearch.py) demonstrates how generators can be useful when sorting through a large dataset looking for specific values.
