# Object Oriented Programming

* This chapter introduced a different way to program using objects and classes to help optimize code. This also introduces class inheritance and how classes connect with one another
* Programs such as ["Enemy"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/oop/enemy.py) and ["Main"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/oop/enemy.py) deal with class inheritance, objects and classes to create villians and heroes in a game.
