# Intro To Python (Udemy)
**These are a few notes and programs that I have written while working on the "Intro to Python Course" on Udemy**

**CHAPTER 1: [Dictionaries](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/tree/main/Dictionaries)** 
  *This chapter introduced dictionaries, and how to use them. The course emphasized when and where to use dictionaries and highlighted situations in which using dictionaries proved to be more useful than using sets or tuples.*
  
**CHAPTER 2: [FILE I/O](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/tree/main/FileIO)**
*This chapter dealt with file operations in a different way annd how python provides built-in functions to read, write, and open files, also explaining in binary terms how files are saved  and how values are saved within the code*

**CHAPTER 3: [Functions and Modules](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/tree/main/modimport)**
*This chapter deals with functions and modules, the course demonstrated how to use import statements and various built-in functions to build different projects and games. Futhermore, the course shows how to make your own functions to optimize your code*

**CHAPTER 4: [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/tree/main/oop)**
*This Chapter introduces "Object Oriented Programming," a different way of programming in which classes are created, this chapter demonstrates how to create a class, what objects are and what class inheritance is and how it works.*

**CHAPTER 5: [Generators](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/tree/main/genexample)**
*This chapter deals with Generators, defining generators and creating them within simple programs. In addition, learning when to use generators and in which cases using them causes one's code to crash.*
