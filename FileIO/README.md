# File I/O

* Within this chapter, I learned a lot about data and binnary numbers, how data is saved and stored within the code, also how python processes various forms of saved data.
* Using terminal and connecting it to my mai editor I was able to learn various ways to read and write data. A point of emphasis on this chapter was the syntax and also watching the way data gets saved.
