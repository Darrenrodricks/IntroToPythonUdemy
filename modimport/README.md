# Functions and Modules (ModImport)

* In this chapter, I learned how to create my own functions and learned how they work within a module. All of the code that is associated with this chapte deals with functions built-in to python or functions that I have created,
* Programs such as ["Blackjack"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/modimport/blackjack.py) and ["screen"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/modimport/screen.py) were very difficlt to create because they have multiple functions within them, coding along with the course proved to be very useful when dealing with these longer programs.
