# Dictionaries

* For the programs within this chapter, they are mainly focused on helping me understand the basics of dicitionaries and how to apply them correctly also, how to add and remove values to a dictionary.
* programs such as ["fruit"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/Dictionaries/fruit.py) and ["sets"](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntroToPythonUdemy/blob/main/Dictionaries/sets.py)  allowed me to learn the basics of the concept with terms and built-in functions that I am already familiar with.
